### Python API Tested and Working

```python
import openneighbor
from openneighbor.core.models.openneighbor import OpenNeighbor

# Package metadata
print(f"OpenNeighbor v{openneighbor.__version__}")
print(f"Author: {openneighbor.__author__} <{openneighbor.__email__}>")

# Model creation and usage
config = {'hidden_dim': 128, 'num_users': 100, 'num_items': 500}
model = OpenNeighbor(config)
print(f"Model created with {model.count_parameters()} parameters")
```
